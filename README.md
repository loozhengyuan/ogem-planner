# OGEM Planner
This project was created to help fellow NBS kiddos to narrow down. The current website on NBS intranet isn't really user-friendly and I spent some time just to narrow down the Uni. 

The database is updated daily at 5am with NBS OGEM's database. While you can almost rely on this tool to pick which Uni you're interested in, please also conduct your own research to make your choice. 

This tool is still very very new, so pardon the bugs. If you do encounter any bugs, feel free to report it in the Github repo. 

Have fun!
