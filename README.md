# OGEM Planner
This project was created to help fellow NBS students to find host universities that matches the modules they want to clear on exchange, something that is lacking in NBS exchange site. The database is updated daily to keep in sync with NBS's site. 

This site takes no responsibility for any repercussions as a result of relying on any information of this site. Please double-check with NBS Exchange site to make sure. 

This tool is still very very new, so pardon the bugs. If you do encounter any, please feel free to create an issue in the Github repo. Thank you!

Thanks!
